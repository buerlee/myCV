Sir/Madam

I am writing to apply for a position in software developing role and  I'm ready for new challenges.

I have substantial experience in web based software development in Java. I have worked on an auto billing system for Fronde System Group and assisted with developing the software.  
Currently, I am a full-time employee at Syl Semantics as a Java developer. My responsibility is to provide software services for Syl Semantics's solutions. The key responsibilities I am taking are:

      - Writing code for assigned functions based on Java, HTML, CSS,     
        Javascript (jQuery) and jersey. 
      - Testing assigned functions/modules.
      - Carrying out other SDLC related tasks as assigned.

Because of this experience, I can make a direct and immediate contribution to any company. 

And I am a passionate lifelong learner for new technology. And I am an active Github user, for example, I like using my spare time to write Go and I have built a simple Instant Messaging program using Go. All of this can make me a perfect software engineer to a IT company.  

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.



Yours sincerely,

Yan Dai
