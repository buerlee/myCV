Dear Sir/Madam

It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position Developer-Internal applications for __. As a software developer with over two years' experience, I am sure that my diverse skills and qualifications will make me an asset to the project team and the company.

As you will see from the attached resume, I've built my career in variety of roles, mostly in small software companies where I was not just a software developer but also a technology whiz and devops. I thrive in an environment where no two work days are exactly the same.

I have substantial experience in software development in Java. I have worked on an internal project for Fronde System Group to automate the billing system: I have designed and developed the business logic in Java. And the project has been finalised by the company and being used as a standard process in the billing pipeline.

Currently, I am a full-time employee at Syl Semantics as a Java developer. My responsibility is to provide software services for Syl Semantics's solutions. I have developed several internal used crawlers for google drive, twitter, evernote and dropbox. One of my recent projects involved coordinating a IBM Lotus Notes crawler for a government client: I developed, deployed and optimised the IBM Lotus Notes crawler (doubled the performance). I'm also a fanatic for details. When I did the IBM Lotus Notes crawler, I found a minor bug in the IBM Lotus Notes api. The bug can cause serious memory leak and eventually crash the server. I reported the bug to the project manager and was proved by IBM. 

Last but certainly not least, I want you to know that I'm a lifelong learner and passionate blogger for every new technologies. I've learnt Go (a programming language developed by Google) using my spare time and developed several projects including a simple chat program. Currently, I'm teaching myself to program in AngularJS. You can find all my personal projects on my Github(https://github.com/alvindaiyan). I'm also an active blogger. I like writing down and sharing all my learning and thoughts in my blog (http://alvindaiyan.github.io/).


In closing, I am thrilled at the possibility of being involved in the new castle almost literally from the ground up, and would love the opportunity to meet with you and discuss the value that I can bring to __. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.



Yours sincerely,

Yan Dai
