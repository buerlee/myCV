It is with great enthusiasm that I submit my application for the position Developer - Internal applications for __. As a software developer with over two years' experience, I am sure that my diverse skills and qualifications will make me an asset to the project team.

Currently, I am a full-time employee at Syl Semantics as a Java developer. My responsibility is to provide software services for Syl Semantics's solutions. The key responsibilities I am taking are:

        Javascript (jQuery) and jersey.

Because of this experience, I can make a direct and immediate contribution to any company.
